Dear Sir/ Madam 

This is a description of my github account. When you clicked it on my CV, you linked here :)

My github account is mainly devoted to my personal development. All of them I did in my spare time. From 2013 to the present, I work and study in a secrecy unit in Which it's difficult to access the Internet.

This library contains the configuration files of my personal Linux. And some tools and automated deployment script of corresponding servers which dedicated to my personal development. The server is deployed on my personal vps. It also include some my practice programmer.

Thank you so much for your time.

Best,
Milo Niu
